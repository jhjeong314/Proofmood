# Proofmood

Proofmood is a computer logic system started in 2009.

Currently it is hosted at [https://proofmood.mindconnect.cc](https://proofmood.mindconnect.cc).  This website is based on LAMP. The logic engine is written in JavaScript.

In 2023, I decided to move to Django and rewrite the logic engine in Python.

You'll need a nodding knowledge in Python and Jupyter Notebook to read this repo.
