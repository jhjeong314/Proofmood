A <line_annotated> is *verified* iff it is one of the following:
* <comment> or <blank>
* <formula> is of the form alpha or not alpha and <premise> is empty and <rule_of_inference> is "LEM"
* <formula> is alpha and there exists alpha in a node *before* the <formula>
* <formula> is alpha and there exist beta imp alpha and beta before alpha and <rule_of_inference> is "elim" "imp"
* ..
* ..

A <proof> is *verified* iff all <line_annotated> are verified.
