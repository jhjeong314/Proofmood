A <line_annotated> is *verified* iff it is one of the following:
* <node_identifier> (<comment> or <blank>)
* n 'alpha or not alpha' and <rule_of_inference> is "LEM" and <premise> is empty 
* n 'alpha' and rule of inference is "repeat" and <premise> is node_identifier m there exists m 'alpha' *before* n 'alpha'
* n 'alpha' and <rule_of_inference> is "elim" "imp" and <premise> is m, k where there exist m 'beta' and k 'beta imp alpha' *before* n 'alpha'
* ..
* ..

A <proof> is *verified* iff all <line_annotated> are verified.
